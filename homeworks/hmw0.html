      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your computer system as a peaceful neighborhood at night. 
        Everything seems quiet, until someone starts opening windows that shouldn’t be open.  
        <strong>Statistics</strong> is that clever detective neighbor watching through the blinds, 
        keeping track of what’s normal and spotting the moment something strange happens.

    <!-- What is Statistics -->
    <section>
      <h2>What is Statistics?</h2>
      <p>
        Statistics is the science of <strong>collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data</strong>.  
        It transforms raw numbers into insight, helping us discover trends, detect patterns, and make predictions.  
        In simpler words: statistics is how we make sense of chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s understanding traffic accidents, vaccine effectiveness, or website visitors, 
        statistics turns a sea of data into clear direction. And when applied to cybersecurity, 
        it becomes much more powerful, a shield.

    <!-- Why it's useful for Cybersecurity -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why Statistics Matters in Cybersecurity</h2>
      <ul style="line-height:1.8;">
        <li>📊 <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> –> It notices when “normal” behavior suddenly looks suspicious.</li>
        <li>📈 <strong>Predictive Defense</strong> –> By analyzing previous attacks, it helps anticipate future ones.</li>
        <li>🔐 <strong>Risk Modeling</strong> –> Converts “possibilities” into probabilities so organizations can prioritize their defenses.</li>
        <li>🤖 <strong>AI & Machine Learning</strong> –> Every smart security algorithm starts with statistical foundations.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- New Section: Bachelor Thesis Experience -->
    <section>
      <h2>Personal Experience: My Bachelor Thesis</h2>
      <p>
        During my Bachelor’s degree, I worked on a project entitled 
        <em>“Design and Implementation of a Cloud-Based Monitoring and Alert System for the PagoPA S.p.A. systems.”</em>  
        The goal was to develop a software system capable of recognizing <strong>anomalous activity patterns</strong> 
        by analyzing the error and log data generated by users and employees within the helpdesk platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution leveraged a cloud infrastructure composed of 
        <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong>, 
        <strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service</strong>, and 
        <strong>Amazon Simple Email Service</strong>.  
        These services worked together to collect logs, detect irregular behaviors, and 
        send real-time reports and alerts directly to <strong>Slack</strong>, a collaborative framework used internally at PagoPA 
        for communication between team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statistics played a crucial role in this system, enabling the identification of 
        <strong>legitimate versus suspicious activities</strong> 
        based on patterns extracted from log groups and their frequency.  
        This experience demonstrated to me that statistics, when combined with modern cloud technologies, 
        is not merely theoretical, it can become an intelligent and automated form of <strong>cyber defense</strong>.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In the end, statistics is not just about numbers, it’s about <em>understanding patterns in uncertainty</em>.  
        In cybersecurity, it’s the quiet detective that never sleeps, analyzing every byte, 
        finding clues before the hacker even strikes.  
        Because in this field, <strong>numbers don’t lie… but they can definitely save your data.</strong>
